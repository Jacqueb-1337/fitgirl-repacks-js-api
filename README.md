# fitgirl-repacks-js-api
A JavaScript API to search titles in the official FitGirl Repacks site.

Obviously, you won't be able to use this on your website unless you have some way to disable CORS. This is actually intended for web-based apps such as Electron.js or NW.js.

The `api.js` file has an example of how to use the API at EOF.
